## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The basic pre-work task was quite simple and I had no difficulties in completing it. However, I did encounter some issues while I was trying to code some of the optional features. What I first struggled with was properly speeding up the clue playback after every turn. But after a few trials and errors, I figured out the optimal speed for each turn. My next problem occurred during the random pattern feature. I wasn’t familiar with JavaScript’s Math.random function (syntax), nor was I aware of some of the other math functions. After I googled an explanation on the math functions, I was able to create the random pattern feature. 
There was a challenge which I encountered and was not able to overcome it. I spent most of my time using the “Show Next to the Code” glitch feature. But before submitting my task, I discovered that when I opened my work in a separate (new) window, the sound feature did not work. And sometimes, it did not work with the code on the side glitch feature either. I reviewed my code over and over again, but was unsuccessful in finding a solution. What I did notice was that only immediately after editing (or just clicking on any of the code itself), the sound feature worked.] 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[During the task I had a lot of questions regarding some of the syntax rules of the three languages. But as I worked more and more, my questions began answering themselves. I really enjoyed working on this task because I learned a lot from it. As for having any web development questions, I was just amazed at how three different languages worked so well together. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript seem to benefit each other's weaknesses. I would love to just continue to learn more about some of the cool features that the three languages offer and perhaps even expose myself to other web development languages.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time, I would’ve loved to try to code some of the other optional features. I would also try to make the game itself look a bit more appealing. For example, through the use of images and small animations. Adding different difficulty levels would definitely improve the game. Along with having more goals in the game other than just beating the computer. Most games now have an account system, to save player data and to compete with other users. I don’t know if JavaScript is capable of storing data but I am sure that there is another language that can offer such a feature.]
